This is the docker file from 1.8. Please for info about older dockerfile look into 1.8.


In 3.5 I used as a base node:8-alpine, removed unneeded lists removed default user created new one and gave it ownership of the code running in the container.

To build the image you self:

1. git clone git@github.com:NorthernLion/WeatherWatch.git
2. cd WeatherWatch
--- Copy paste the Docker file from task into here ---
3. docker build -t vether .
4. docker run -p 3001:3001 vether
